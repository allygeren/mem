# mem

Developed with Flutter and Dart, Mem is your go-to memory matching game, compatible seamlessly with both Android and Apple. With its visually appealing and user friendly UI, Mem offers an enjoyable game to all users. This game consists of various levels, where users race against the clock to complete their matching sequence. The timer functionality was developed using the Stopwatch Timer library via Flutter. The progress a user makes through levels is saved to the local device using the Shared Preferences library, meaning high scores and levels completed persist after the game ends.
